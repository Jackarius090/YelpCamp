# Yelp Camp

Hey this is Yelp Camp, an application I built following Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

Technologies used include: [EJS](https://ejs.co/), Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/), [Cloudinary Image API](https://cloudinary.com/image-api), [Map Tiler](https://www.maptiler.com/) and [joi](https://joi.dev/)

Check it out through the link below, it may take a long time to load (60 seconds+) as [Render](https://render.com/) spins down the website with inactivity.
